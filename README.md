### User guide

#### 1. Understand the purpose of Books-Mixer AI

Books-Mixer AI is a web application that lets you mix the plots of two books based on your instructions and on the information it can retrieve about the books from Wikipedia.

#### 2. How it works 

Books-Mixer AI works on a very simple chat interface, in addition to which you have four text boxes, where you need to specify:
- the titles of the two books you want to mix
- your OpenAI API key
- your ModelsLab API keys (more on that in the [dedicated section](#3-get-your-api-keys))

You can then type your instructions for plot generation directly in the chat space.

#### 3. Get your API keys

To get your API keys:

- **OpenAI**: you need to [subscribe](https://openai.com/) to OpenAI services and then you can [login](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview) to your personal dashboard where, under the **API keys** section, you will be able to get your personal key by clicking on `+ Create new secret key`.
- **ModelsLab**: you need to [sign up](https://modelslab.com/register) on ModelsLab platform and then, from the dashboard, just go to **API settings** and click on `Create new key`.

You just now have to copy them and paste in the dedicated text boxes on the app!üöÄ
